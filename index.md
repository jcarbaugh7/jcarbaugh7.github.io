## Selected Projects

### Geospatial analysis of demographic and tree coverage data in Boston

As a partner project with advocacy group Speak for the Trees, my group and I worked on analyzing the connection between tree coverage the demographic makeup of Boston to advise tree-planting policy. Maps and visualizations were built using QGIS, and kriging was utilized to account for spatial autocorrelation in the model.

### Changepoint detection to observe the relationship between child heart rates and familiarity with music 

In previous studies, it has been shown that the presence of an unfamiliar object
can be linked to a particular response in heart rate. This research project tests this conclusion with unfamiliar auditory stimuli instead, using changepoint analysis, linear mixed effect panel models, and extensive visualizations.

### Physical therapy feature extraction using dimension reduction and neural networks

Our client had a large amount of data measuring the walking cycle of patients in and out of physical therapy after knee surgeries. The goal of the project was to extract new features and patterns within the walk cycles. This was mainly done using principal component analysis and an autoencoder neural network.

### Parcel valuations of Massachusetts through random forests and other ensemble methods

Utilizing real estate sales and land data, I was able to use random forests, boosting, and k-nearest neighbors to estimate valuations of parcels in Massachusetts. The purpose of the project was to build a potential plan for land acquisition through easements in order to prevent forest loss, though the results can be used in other contexts.

### Comparisons of glycocalyx using ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests

The glycocalyx is a layer of proteins lining the outflow pathway of the eye and is minimally studied, despite its potential link to glaucoma. The client for this project wanted me to compare measurements of the glycocalyx along different metrics, and note potential differences between control and treated eyes. This was accomplished by using ANOVA, Tukey's honest significance difference tests, and multilevel modeling.

### Multilevel modeling of NCAA football game attendance

Football games act as major fundraising events for many of the United States' largest universities, and can act as community unifying events. In this project, I used multilevel modeling to inquire about what factors affect attendance to football games, as well as postulate what universities can do to increase attendance and, as consequence, revenue.
